2 files exist in this repo

Collecttion.json - This is where all the tests are sitting
Environment.json - This is the environment file which has all the configuration that is needed to execute the test.

please make sure you have this environments file selected or the tests will not run.

Please note : For POST, PUT and DELETE  - I was unable to locate these type of endpoints on the openweathermap.org so I alternatively used https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
